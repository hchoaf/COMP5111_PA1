Fault Location : Line 416

Fault Line : for (int i = 1; i < sz; i++) {


Corresponding fixing patch:
for (int i = 0; i < sz; i++) {


Rationale that it is a fault:
This function checks if the CharSequence contains only Unicode digits.
However, according to the for loop in line 416, it skips the first character of the sequence.
