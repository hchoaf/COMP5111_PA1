Fault Line : return ((year & 3) == 0) || (((year % 100) != 0) || ((year % 400) == 0));

Corresponding fixing patch:
return ((year & 3) == 0) && (((year % 100) != 0) || ((year % 400) == 0));

Rationale that it is a fault:
Leap year checking process is as follows:
If a year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
However, a year is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it is not a leap year.
According to this set of rules, a year is a leap year if it is,
- divisible by 4
- and not divisible by 100 or divisible by 400
