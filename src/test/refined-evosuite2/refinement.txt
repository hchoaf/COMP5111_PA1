Explanation:
I added one test case with assertAll, which contains 3 assert statements, each for each fault.
GregorianTasks.isLeapYear(1900) should return false, but according to the the current implementation, it returns true.
So I added this as one of the assert statements.
StringTasks.isNumeric("a123") should return false, but according to the current implementation, it returns true. 
So I added this as one of the assert statements.
StringTasks.splitByCharacterType("SS") should return {"S", "S"}, but according to the current implementation, it returns {"SS"}.
So I added this as one of the assert statements.
